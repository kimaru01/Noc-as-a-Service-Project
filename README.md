## Noc-as-a-Service-Project
## Severity Issues
## Overview
Severities are essential documentation on impacted internal/customer services and products that have been affected and or experienced data corruption.
## Process
When Data gets compromised or corrupted, such as: slow transactions response time; test issues; or DNS Robot moving a service to secondary; the system will alert the infrastructure team on the issue via attention alerts and through email. Based on the severity of the impacted service/product, the Noc team is required to escalate the issue in a timely manner to the appropriate architecture team to investigate it and determined a cause. A sev also needs to be open based on the impact or severity of the issue and assigned to the appropriate business unit.
